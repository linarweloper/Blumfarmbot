# description
"Our Blum farming bot offers flexible settings tailored to individual needs. Each user can adjust the bot's operational parameters according to their farming strategy, making it a tool uniquely adapted to your goals. Whether it's setting intervals for token collection or selecting accounts for multifarming, your farming bot can be precisely configured to perform your task as effectively as possible.

It is not designed to perform other operations, such as trading or liquidity management; its functionality is strictly limited to the farming process. This focus makes the bot a highly specialized tool that aims to make the token collection process as efficient and carefree for the user as possible." 

* Bot's interface and instructions support English language only.
